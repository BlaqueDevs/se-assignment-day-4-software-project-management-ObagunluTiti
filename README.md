## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Waterfall Methodology
Waterfall is a traditional, linear, and sequential approach to software development. It is characterized by its distinct phases, which are typically executed in a fixed order:
     Requirements: Define and document all project requirements.
     Design: Create architectural and design specifications based on requirements.
     Implementation: Develop the software according to the design specifications.
      Verification: Test the software to ensure it meets the requirements.
      Maintenance: Fix bugs and make updates after deployment.
Advantages
Clear Structure: The sequential approach provides a clear, structured path with well-defined phases, making it easy to manage and understand.
Well-Defined Requirements: Comprehensive requirement gathering at the start helps in creating a detailed design and reduces ambiguity.
Easy to Manage: The fixed phases and clear documentation facilitate straightforward project management and tracking.
Predictable Timelines: The linear nature often leads to predictable timelines and budgets if requirements are well-defined and stable.
Disadvantages
Inflexibility: Changes are difficult and costly to implement once the project is underway. Adapting to new requirements or changes can be challenging.
Late Testing: Testing occurs late in the process, which means issues may only be discovered after significant development has occurred.
Risk of Misalignment: Requirements gathered upfront might become outdated as the project progresses, leading to potential misalignment with current needs.
Delayed Feedback: Stakeholders may not see a working product until late in the project, making feedback and iteration less frequent.
 
 Agile Methodology
Agile is an iterative, incremental approach to software development. It emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. Agile methodologies include frameworks like Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP). The key principles involve:

      Iterative Development: Work is done in small, iterative cycles (sprints) with frequent reassessment and adaptation.
      Collaboration: Close collaboration between cross-functional teams and stakeholders is encouraged.
      Customer Feedback: Regular feedback is sought from customers and stakeholders to ensure alignment with their needs and expectations.
       Continuous Improvement: Emphasizes continuous delivery and improvement of the product.
Advantages
Flexibility: Agile accommodates changes and new requirements throughout the development process, making it adaptable to evolving needs.
Early Delivery: Working software is delivered frequently, allowing stakeholders to see progress and provide feedback early and often.
Customer Involvement: Regular customer feedback ensures the product is aligned with user needs and expectations.
Risk Management: Continuous testing and iterative development help identify and address issues early, reducing the risk of major failures.
Disadvantages
Scope Creep: Frequent changes and lack of a fixed scope can lead to scope creep, where the project may expand beyond the original intentions.
Less Predictability: The iterative nature can make it difficult to predict timelines and costs accurately.
Requires Experience: Agile requires a high level of team collaboration and experience, which can be challenging to maintain.
Documentation: Agile’s focus on working software over documentation can lead to inadequate documentation, which may pose challenges for future maintenance or scaling.
